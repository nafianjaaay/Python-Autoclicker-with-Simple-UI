# AutoClicker
AutoClicker is a simple Python program that lets you automate mouse clicks on your computer. With a customizable interval and a user-friendly interface, you can easily set up and run the program to perform repetitive clicking tasks with ease.

This program uses the pynput library to handle mouse clicks and keyboard events. It creates an AutoClicker object that listens for the Ctrl+Shift key combination to start and stop clicking at the specified interval. The program also has a simple GUI that allows the user to enter the click interval and start/stop the auto-clicking, as well as an exit button to close the program.

To run this program, you will need to install the pynput library by running pip install pynput in your terminal.
